     * A micro:bit Makecode driver for SHT3x devices
     *
     * Due to size limitations, many micro:bit drivers do not implement floating
     * point numbers. Frequently, this leads to a loss of precision. This driver
     * takes a different approach. Recognising that the Makecode interpreter
     * already has floating point support, this driver returns values at 100x
     * their normal value, using a typescript shim to divide down to an easily
     * representable value.

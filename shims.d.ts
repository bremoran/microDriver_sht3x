     * A micro:bit Makecode driver for SHT3x devices
     *
     * Due to size limitations, many micro:bit drivers do not implement floating
     * point numbers. Frequently, this leads to a loss of precision. This driver
     * takes a different approach. Recognising that the Makecode interpreter
     * already has floating point support, this driver returns raw values and
     * converts them to floating piont in a typescript shim to ensure no loss
     * of precision.
